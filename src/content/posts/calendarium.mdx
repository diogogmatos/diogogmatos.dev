**Calendarium** is an open-source Next.js web app that aims to provide students in the Bachelor's or Master's programs in Software Engineering at [UMinho](https://www.uminho.pt) with **easy access to information on academic events (like exams and other due dates), class schedules, and extracurricular activities organized by the student center.**

The project was started in 2022 by some colleagues at [CeSIUM](https://cesium.pt) (University of Minho's Software Engineering Student Center), and I had the opportunity to pick it up at a very early stage in September of that same year. Since then, I have grown very close to the project and have become its main maintainer and contributor, implementing **over 40 new features** and improvements.\
\
The platform is loved by students of all years, frequently reaching **over a thousand views per day** and having had a total of **24k views** just in February 2025.

## üïπÔ∏è Main Functionality

### Sidebar

The sidebar is a central feature of the platform, allowing users to manage all their preferences and navigate the app. Here, they can switch between the Events and Schedule views.

### Events View

The main objective of this view is to provide the student with an easy-to-use calendar where they can view events relevant to them, like their exams and due dates, and events relevant to any student, like holiday periods and the start/end of the semester.

To make this view a personalized experience, the student can select the subjects they are attending from the collapsible menus in the sidebar:

Clicking an event will give you a dialog with detailed information:

### &#x20;Schedule View

The schedule view is especially popular among our students because it provides an interactive experience for schedule building, in a course where having more than 10 different shifts for a single class is a common occurrence.

The official schedule view provided by UMinho only offers a single view of all classes and shifts, which can be confusing and overwhelming. Students would go over the giant document by hand and circle the shifts they are enrolled in to only then be able to see their final and unique schedule.

In a similar fashion to how the Events view works, students simply select the shifts they are enrolled in from the collapsible menus of the sidebar and watch the corresponding class appear in the weekly view of the calendar.

Clicking a class will give you a dialog with detailed information:
